Christchurch one of the largest cities in New Zealand is located on the east coast of New Zealand’s South Island with a population of 350,000 known as the Garden city with outstanding leisure and a wide range of other facilities. Christchurch Airport is one of the busiest operating networks with approximately 200,000 flights per year which serves as the base for both NZ and American flights to the Antarctic which now had developed 50dBA Ldn airport noise contour, leaving the city with noise difficulties with the developing traffic in roads and pollution as a result. The analysis was done keeping the constraints in mind and determining the best location for a future residential plant to live in a less polluted area with more green space and away from all those noise factors. This would be highly beneficial for people who want to live in a calm and peaceful location and supporting the health and well-being of our communities.

Tensions between residential land uses and airports are a problem worldwide, and Christchurch is no exception. The research identifies the difficulties with respect to the airport noise and comments on the outcome of 50 dBA versus 55 dBA contours as a constraint in urban development. However, it is not about just the urban or rural development that concerns near the airport zone rather it is about people living in the noise-affected areas keeping in mind the benefit to be raised to all. Nonetheless, remodeling the contours at the 50 dBA outer urban boundary has displaced residential growth between the airport and city to other parts of the city.

After Analysis, we could observe that areas Sparks road ‘Halswell’, ‘Wigram’, ‘Awatea’, ‘South Halswell’, ‘Marshlands’, ‘Papanui’ are the best location in Christchurch to build the future residential site for a peaceful and healthy living supporting the well-being of our communities eradicating the constraint factors.
