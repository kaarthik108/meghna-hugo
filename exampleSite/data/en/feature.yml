  title: How I dabbled into Data Science
  content: "To paraphrase Hemingway, first suddenly, then gradually. Academic jobs
    are tough to find, especially in oversaturated fields such as electronics. Initially,
    I dabbled in tech unboxing and tech reviews, but once I discovered data science,
    I was hooked on to it. Data science provides the right balance between science
    and technology that Iâ€™ve always looked for. \n\nI always hustle to learn and apply
    my learnings in the real-world environment to get deep insights and thus helping
    businesses and people."
